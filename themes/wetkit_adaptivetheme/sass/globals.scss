/**
 * Global Styles
 *
 * We use the "global" namespace to denote files that load for all
 * devices as opposed to CSS embedded in media queries.
 *
 * This file imports all the global stylesheets into one file.
 * This is done purely as a house-keeping exercise and to make it easy
 * to unset one stylesheet by simply commenting it out.
 *
 * When CSS aggregation is ON the @imports are resolved and only one
 * aggreated file is generated, so there is zero performance overhead
 * in using @import. In other words this files content is replaced by
 * all the CSS in the imported stylseheets, then compressed and cached
 * by Drupal in the public files directory.
 *
 * The modular structure is very similar to Zen and the actual CSS used in
 * some of these files is lifted from the Zen theme - this is to  provide
 * a consistant themer experience for those who have used Zen. Adaptivetheme
 * adds additional classes, makes minor adjustments to some classes, id's
 * and the actual styles, and adds base styles for tables and Panels.
