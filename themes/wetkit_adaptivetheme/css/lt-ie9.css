 * Internet Explorer overrides and fixes for lt IE9.
 *
 * To use this file uncomment the declaration in your themes info file.
 *
 * Adaptivetheme includes several powerful tools for dealing with IE.
 *
 * 1. You can set IE conditional stylesheets from the info file - see your themes
 *    info file for documentation.
 * 
 * 2. Use IE conditional classes - in html.tpl.php the html element is wrapped
 *    in conditional comments to allow to you target different versions of IE.
 * 
 *    These are the classes you can use:
 * 
 *    .iem7 (IE7 Mobile)
 *    .lt-ie7 (less than IE7)
 *    .lt-ie8 (less than IE8)
 *    .lt-ie9 (less than IE9)
 *
 *    You can use these classes in any CSS file, including this one, so you only
 *    need to load one conditional stylesheet, or even none by placing all IE
 *    styles in your regular stylesheets using the conditional classes.
