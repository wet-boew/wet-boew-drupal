/** responsive.custom.css is for custom media queries that are not set via the theme settings, such as cascading media queries.  By default all the other responsive stylesheets used in Adaptivetheme use a "stacking method", however cascading media queries use a waterfall method so you can leverage the cascade and inheritance for all browsers that support media queries, regardless of screen size.  @SEE http://zomigi.com/blog/essential-considerations-for-crafting-quality-media-queries/#mq-overlap-stack  NOTE: this file loads by default, to disable got to your theme settings and look under the "CSS" settings tab. */
