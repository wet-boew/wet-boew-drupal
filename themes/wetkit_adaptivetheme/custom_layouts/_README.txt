Example Page Layout Plugin
--------------------------

If you are NOT developing a page layout plugin you can safely delete this
entire directory from your sub-theme.

If you are developing a page layout plugin see the developer notes in
AT Core /layouts/core/_README.txt, there are many code comments in the
three_col_grail inc file also.

You can enable the "naked" example layout plugin by uncommenting the
info file entry in your subthemes info file. Look for:

Custom Page Layout Plugins:
plugins[page_layout][layouts] = custom_layouts
